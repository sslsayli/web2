    <h2>Cloud Service Models</h2>
    <br>There are the following three types of cloud service models -

    <br>1)Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
    <br>2)Platform as a Service (PaaS)
    <br>3)Software as a Service (SaaS)

    <hr>

    <h2>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</h2>
    <br>IaaS is also known as Hardware as a Service (HaaS). It is a
    <br>computing infrastructure managed over the internet. The main
    <br>advantage of using IaaS is that it helps users to avoid the
    <br>cost and complexity of purchasing and managing the physical servers.

    <h3>Characteristics of IaaS</h3>
    <br>There are the following characteristics of IaaS -

    <br>*Resources are available as a service
    <br>*Services are highly scalable
    <br>*Dynamic and flexible
    <br>*GUI and API-based access
    <br>*Automated administrative tasks

    <h4>Example:</h4>
    <br>DigitalOcean, Linode, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google
    <br>Compute Engine (GCE), Rackspace, and Cisco Metacloud.

    <h2>Platform as a Service (PaaS)</h2>
    <br>PaaS cloud computing platform is created for the programmer to develop,
    <br>test, run, and manage the applications.

    <h3>Characteristics of PaaS</h3>
    <br>There are the following characteristics of PaaS -

    <br>*Accessible to various users via the same development application.
    <br>*Integrates with web services and databases.
    <br>*Builds on virtualization technology, so resources can easily be
    <br>scaled up or down as per the organization's need.
    <br>*Support multiple languages and frameworks.
    <br>*Provides an ability to "Auto-scale".

    <h4>Example:</h4>
    <br>AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Windows Azure, Heroku, Force.com, Google App Engine,
    <br>Apache Stratos, Magento Commerce Cloud, and OpenShift.

    <h2>Software as a Service (SaaS)</h2>
    <br>SaaS is also known as "on-demand software". It is a software in which the
    <br>applications are hosted by a cloud service provider. Users can access these
    <br>applications with the help of internet connection and web browser.

    <h3>Characteristics of SaaS</h3>
    <br>There are the following characteristics of SaaS -

    <br>*Managed from a central location
    <br>*Hosted on a remote server
    <br>*Accessible over the internet
    <br>*Users are not responsible for hardware and software updates. Updates are applied automatically.
    <br>*The services are purchased on the pay-as-per-use basis

    <h4>Example:</h4>
    <br>BigCommerce, Google Apps, Salesforce, Dropbox, ZenDesk, Cisco WebEx, ZenDesk, Slack, and GoToMeeting.

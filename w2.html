    <h2>Public Cloud</h2>
    <br>Public cloud is open to all to store and access information via the Internet using the pay-per-usage method.
    <br>In public cloud, computing resources are managed and operated by the Cloud Service Provider (CSP).

    <h4>Example: </h4>
    <br>Amazon elastic compute cloud (EC2), IBM SmartCloud Enterprise,
    <br> Microsoft, Google App Engine, Windows Azure Services Platform.

    <h2>Advantages of Public Cloud</h2>
    <br>*Public cloud is owned at a lower cost than the private and hybrid cloud.
    <br>*Public cloud is maintained by the cloud service provider, so do not need to worry about the maintenance.
    <br>*Public cloud is easier to integrate. Hence it offers a better flexibility approach to consumers.
    <br>*Public cloud is location independent because its services are delivered through the internet.
    <br>*Public cloud is highly scalable as per the requirement of computing resources.
    <br>*It is accessible by the general public, so there is no limit to the number of users.

    <h2>Disadvantages of Public Cloud</h2>
    <br>*Public Cloud is less secure because resources are shared publicly.
    <br>*Performance depends upon the high-speed internet network link to the cloud provider.
    <br>*The Client has no control of data.

    <h2>Private Cloud</h2>
    <br>Private cloud is also known as an internal cloud or corporate cloud. It is used by organizations to build and
    <br>manage their own data centers internally or by the third party. It can be deployed using Opensource tools such
    <br>as Openstack and Eucalyptus.

    <br>Based on the location and management, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) divide private cloud
    <br> into the following two parts-

    <br>*On-premise private cloud
    <br>*Outsourced private cloud
    <h2>Advantages of Private Cloud</h2>
    <br>*Private cloud provides a high level of security and privacy to the users.
    <br>*Private cloud offers better performance with improved speed and space capacity.
    <br>*It allows the IT team to quickly allocate and deliver on-demand IT resources.
    <br>*The organization has full control over the cloud because it is managed by the
    <br> organization itself. So, there is no need for the organization to depends on anybody.
    <br>*It is suitable for organizations that require a separate cloud for their personal use
    <br> and data security is the first priority.

    <h2>Disadvantages of Private Cloud</h2>
    <br>*Skilled people are required to manage and operate cloud services.
    <br>*Private cloud is accessible within the organization, so the area of operations is limited.
    <br>*Private cloud is not suitable for organizations that have a high user base, and organizations that
    <br> do not have the prebuilt infrastructure, sufficient manpower to maintain and manage the cloud.

    <hr>

    <h2>Hybrid Cloud</h2>
    <br>Hybrid Cloud is a combination of the public cloud and the private cloud. we can say:

    <h3> Private CloudHybrid Cloud = Public Cloud +</h3>

    <br>Hybrid cloud is partially secure because the services which are running on the public cloud
    <br> can be accessed by anyone, while the services which are running on a private cloud can be
    <br> accessed only by the organization's users.
    <h4>Example: </h4>
    <br>Google Application Suite (Gmail, Google Apps, and Google Drive), Office 365 (MS Office on
    <br>the Web and One Drive), Amazon Web Services

    <h2>Advantages of Hybrid Cloud</h2>
    <br>*Hybrid cloud is suitable for organizations that require more security than the public cloud.
    <br>*Hybrid cloud helps you to deliver new products and services more quickly.
    <br>*Hybrid cloud provides an excellent way to reduce the risk.
    <br>*Hybrid cloud offers flexible resources because of the public cloud and secure resources because
    <br>of the private cloud.

    <h2>Disadvantages of Hybrid Cloud</h2>
    <br>*In Hybrid Cloud, security feature is not as good as the private cloud.
    <br>*Managing a hybrid cloud is complex because it is difficult to manage more than one type of deployment model.
    <br>* In the hybrid cloud, the reliability of the services depends on cloud service providers.

    <hr>

    <h2>Community Cloud</h2>
    <br>Community cloud allows systems and services to be accessible by a group of several organizations
    <br>to share the information between the organization and a specific community. It is owned, managed, and
    <br>operated by one or more organizations in the community, a third party, or a combination of them.
    <h4>Example: </h4>
    <br>Health Care community cloud

    <h2>Advantages of Community Cloud</h2>
    <br>*Community cloud is cost-effective because the whole cloud is being shared by several organizations or communities.
    <br>*Community cloud is suitable for organizations that want to have a collaborative cloud with more security features
    <br>*than the public cloud.It provides better security than the public cloud.
    <br>*It provdes collaborative and distributive environment.
    <br>*Community cloud allows us to share cloud resources, infrastructure, and other capabilities among various organizations.

    <h2>Disadvantages of Community Cloud</h2>
    <br>*Community cloud is not a good choice for every organization.
    <br>*Security features are not as good as the private cloud.
    <br>*It is not suitable if there is no collaboration.
    <br>*The fixed amount of data storage and bandwidth is shared among all community members.

    <h2>Cloud Computing Tutorial</h2>

    <br>Cloud Computing tutorial provides basic and advanced concepts of Cloud Computing.
    <br> Our Cloud Computing tutorial is designed for beginners and professionals.
    <br>Cloud computing is a virtualization-based technology that allows us to create, configure,
    <br>and customize applications via an internet connection.The cloud technology includes a development
    <br>platform, hard disk, software application, and database.

    <h2>What is Cloud Computing ?</h2>


    <br>The term cloud refers to a network or the internet. It is a technology that uses remote servers on the
    <br>internet to store, manage, and access data online rather than local drives. The data can be anything such
    <br>as files, images, documents, audio, video, and more.


    <h3>There are the following operations that we can do using cloud computing:</h3>
    <br>*Developing new applications and services
    <br>*Storage, back up, and recovery of data
    <br>*Hosting blogs and websites
    <br>*Delivery of software on demand
    <br>*Analysis of data
    <br>*Streaming videos and audios


    <hr>

    <h2>Why Cloud Computing?</h2>
    <br>Small as well as large IT companies, follow the traditional methods to provide the IT infrastructure.
    <br>That means for any IT company, we need a Server Room that is the basic need of IT companies.

    <br>In that server room, there should be a database server, mail server, networking, firewalls, routers,
    <br>modem, switches, QPS (Query Per Second means how much queries or load will be handled by the server),
    <br>configurable system, high net speed, and the maintenance engineers.

    <br>To establish such IT infrastructure, we need to spend lots of money. To overcome all these problems and to
    <br> reduce the IT infrastructure cost, Cloud Computing comes into existence.

    <h2>Advantages and Disadvantages of Cloud Computing</h2>

    <h2>Advantages of Cloud Computing</h2>
    <h3>1) Back-up and restore data</h3>
    <br>Once the data is stored in the cloud, it is easier to get back-up and restore that data using the cloud.
    <h3>2) Improved collaboration</h3>
    <br>Cloud applications improve collaboration by allowing groups of people to quickly and easily share
    <br>information in the cloud via shared storage.

    <h3>3) Excellent accessibility</h3>
    <br>Cloud allows us to quickly and easily access store information anywhere, anytime in the whole world,
    <br>using an internet connection. An internet cloud infrastructure increases organization productivity
    <br>and efficiency by ensuring that our data isalways accessible.

    <h3>4) Low maintenance cost</h3>
    <br>Cloud computing reduces both hardware and software maintenance costs for organizations.

    <h3>5) Mobility</h3>
    <br>Cloud computing allows us to easily access all cloud data via mobile.

    <h3>6) IServices in the pay-per-use model</h3>
    <br>Cloud computing offers Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to the users for access
    <br>services on the cloud and pays the charges as per the usage of service.

    <h3>7) Unlimited storage capacity</h3>
    <br>Cloud offers us a huge amount of storing capacity for storing our important data such as documents,
    <br>images, audio, video, etc. in one place.

    <h3>8) Data security</h3>
    <br>Data security is one of the biggest advantages of cloud computing. Cloud offers many advanced features
    <br>related to security and ensures that data is securely stored and handled.

    <hr>

    <h2>Disadvantages of Cloud Computing</h2>
    <h3>1) Internet Connectivity</h3>
    <br>As you know, in cloud computing, every data (image, audio, video, etc.) is stored on the cloud, and we access
    <br>these data through the cloud by using the internet connection. If you do not have good internet connectivity,
    <br>you cannot access these data. However, we have no any other way to access data from the cloud.

    <h3>2) Vendor lock-in</h3>
    <br>Vendor lock-in is the biggest disadvantage of cloud computing. Organizations may face problems when transferring
    <br>their services from one vendor to another. As different vendors provide different platforms, that can cause
    <br>difficulty moving from one cloud to another.

    <h3>3) Limited Control</h3>
    <br>As we know, cloud infrastructure is completely owned, managed, and monitored by the service provider,
    <br>so the cloud users have less control over the function and execution of services within a cloud infrastructure.

    <h3>4) Security</h3>
    <br>Although cloud service providers implement the best security standards to store important information. But,
    <br>before adopting cloud technology, you should be aware that you will be sending all your organization's
    <br>sensitive information to a third party, i.e., a cloud computing service provider. While sending the data on
    <br>the cloud, there may be a chance that your organization's information is hacked by Hackers.

    <h2>History of Cloud Computing</h2>
    <br>Before emerging the cloud computing, there was Client/Server computing which is basically a centralized storage
    <br>in which all the software applications, all the data and all the controls are resided on the server side.

    <br>If a single user wants to access specific data or run a program, he/she need to connect to the server and then
    <br>gain appropriate access, and then he/she can do his/her business.

    <br>Then after, distributed computing came into picture, where all the computers are networked together and share their
    <br>resources when needed.

    <br>On the basis of above computing, there was emerged of cloud computing concepts that later implemented.

    <br>At around in 1961, John MacCharty suggested in a speech at MIT that computing can be sold like a utility,
    <br>just like a water or electricity. It was a brilliant idea, but like all brilliant ideas, it was ahead if
    <br>its time, as for the next few decades, despite interest in the model, the technology simply was not ready for it.

    <br>But of course time has passed and the technology caught that idea and after few years we mentioned that:

    <br>In 1999, Salesforce.com started delivering of applications to users using a simple website. The applications
    <br>were delivered to enterprises over the Internet, and this way the dream of computing sold as utility were true.

    <br>In 2002, Amazon started Amazon Web Services, providing services like storage, computation and even human
    <br>intelligence. However, only starting with the launch of the Elastic Compute Cloud in 2006 a truly commercial
    <br>service open to everybody existed.

    <br>In 2009, Google Apps also started to provide cloud computing enterprise applications.

    <br>Of course, all the big players are present in the cloud computing evolution, some were earlier, some were later.
    <br>In 2009, Microsoft launched Windows Azure, and companies like Oracle and HP have all joined the game. This proves
    <br>that today, cloud computing has become mainstream.

    <h2>How does cloud computing work</h2>
    <br>Assume that you are an executive at a very big corporation. Your particular responsibilities include to make sure
    <br>that all of your employees have the right hardware and software they need to do their jobs. To buy computers for
    <br>everyone is not enough. You also have to purchase software as well as software licenses and then provide these
    <br>softwares to your employees as they require. Whenever you hire a new employee, you need to buy more software or
    <br>make sure your current software license allows another user. It is so stressful that you have to spend lots of money.

    <br>But, there may be an alternative for executives like you. So, instead of installing a suite of software for each
    <br>computer, you just need to load one application. That application will allow the employees to log-in into a
    <br>Web-based service which hosts all the programs for the user that is required for his/her job. Remote servers
    <br>owned by another company and that will run everything from e-mail to word processing to complex data analysis
    <br>programs. It is called cloud computing, and it could change the entire computer industry.

    <br>In a cloud computing system, there is a significant workload shift. Local computers have no longer to do all
    <br>the heavy lifting when it comes to run applications. But cloud computing can handle that much heavy load easily
    <br>and automatically. Hardware and software demands on the user's side decrease. The only thing the user's computer
    <br>requires to be able to run is the cloud computing interface software of the system, which can be as simple as a
    <br>Web browser and the cloud's network takes care of the rest.

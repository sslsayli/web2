    <h2>Virtualization in Cloud Computing</h2>

    <br>Virtualization is the "creation of a virtual (rather than actual) version
    <br>of something, such as a server, a desktop, a storage device, an operating
    <br>system or network resources".

    <br>In other words, Virtualization is a technique, which allows to share a single
    <br>physical instance of a resource or an application among multiple customers
    <br>and organizations. It does by assigning a logical name to a physical storage
    <br>and providing a pointer to that physical resource when demanded.

    <hr>

    <h2>What is the concept behind the Virtualization?</h2>

    <br>Creation of a virtual machine over existing operating system and hardware is
    <br>known as Hardware Virtualization. A Virtual machine provides an environment
    <br>that is logically separated from the underlying hardware.

    <br>The machine on which the virtual machine is going to create is known as Host Machine
    <br>and that virtual machine is referred as a Guest Machine

    <hr>

    <h2>Types of Virtualization:</h2>

    <br>1.Hardware Virtualization.
    <br>2.Operating system Virtualization.
    <br>3.Server Virtualization.
    <br>4.Storage Virtualization.

    <hr>

    <h2>1) Hardware Virtualization:</h2>
    <br>When the virtual machine software or virtual machine manager (VMM) is directly installed
    <br>on the hardware system is known as hardware virtualization.

    <br>The main job of hypervisor is to control and monitoring the processor,
    <br>memory and other hardware resources.

    <br>After virtualization of hardware system we can install different operating system on it
    <br>and run different applications on those OS.

    <h3>Usage:</h3>

    <br>Hardware virtualization is mainly done for the server platforms, because controlling
    <br>virtual machines is much easier than controlling a physical server.

    <hr>

    <h2>2) Operating System Virtualization:</h2>
    <br>When the virtual machine software or virtual machine manager (VMM) is installed on
    <br>the Host operating system instead of directly on the hardware system is known as
    <br>operating system virtualization.

    <h3>Usage:</h3>

    <br>Operating System Virtualization is mainly used for testing the applications on
    <br>different platforms of OS.

    <hr>

    <h2>3) Server Virtualization:</h2>
    <br>When the virtual machine software or virtual machine manager (VMM) is directly installed
    <br>on the Server system is known as server virtualization.

    <h3>Usage:</h3>

    <br>Server virtualization is done because a single physical server can be divided into multiple
    <br>servers on the demand basis and for balancing the load.

    <hr>

    <h2>4) Storage Virtualization:</h2>
    <br>Storage virtualization is the process of grouping the physical storage from multiple network
    <br>storage devices so that it looks like a single storage device.

    <br>Storage virtualization is also implemented by using software applications.

    <h3>Usage:</h3>

    <br>Storage virtualization is mainly done for back-up and recovery purposes.

    <h2>How does virtualization work in cloud computing?</h2>
    <br>Virtualization plays a very important role in the cloud computing technology, normally in the cloud
    <br>computing, users share the data present in the clouds like application etc, but actually with the
    <br>help of virtualization users shares the Infrastructure.

    <br>The main usage of Virtualization Technology is to provide the applications with the standard versions
    <br>to their cloud users, suppose if the next version of that application is released, then cloud provider
    <br>has to provide the latest version to their cloud users and practically it is possible because it is more expensive.

    <br>To overcome this problem we use basically virtualization technology, By using virtualization,
    <br>all severs and the software application which are required by other cloud providers are maintained
    <br>by the third party people, and the cloud providershas to pay the money on monthly or annual basis.

    <hr>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <br>Mainly Virtualization means, running multiple operating systems on a single machine but sharing all the
    <br>hardware resources. And it helps us to provide the pool of IT resources so that we can share these IT
    <br>resources in order get benefits in the business.
